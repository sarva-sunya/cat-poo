The word association and drawing game. Cat Poo as told to me by a Cooper Union alumni. 

The Game 
A prompt (e.g, "dim sum ain't easy") is given to Player 1, who then draws a picture of it. 
Player 2 creates a new text prompt based of of their interpretation of Player 1's picture.
This new prompt is sent to the next player, who makes a picture it. 
The process repeats. 

Next player can be Player 1, game seems to work well around a dim sum table. So ideally 10-12 Players. 
Once game has terminated, somehow, everyone gets to see the chain. 

Challenges 
Player 2 cannot know original prompt 
Game must terminiate. A setting for a certain # of full plays; a timer for quick (20 min) or long (24hrs +) games. 
Settings for prompt difficulty
Mobile-device friendly. 
Local network friendly (everyone nearby can do the prompt on their mobile device) 
Someone maybe already made this (I hope so!)
